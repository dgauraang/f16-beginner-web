                        <h1>Basic Object Oriented JS</h1>
                        <p>An <strong>object</strong> is a way to represent information about <strong>state</strong> and <strong>behavior</strong> in one package. Objects are fundamental to the structure of the web and most apps in general.</p>
				        <p>JavaScript objects are quite different from the objects of other languages, so let's get familiar with them. Then we can start using them to actually manipulate HTML on the page.</p>
				        <p>In Javascript, objects are essentially represented by a structure that associates keys with values. A key is a string that is the name of something and a value can be anything that you want to associate with that key. In other languages, this data structure is called dictionary or map.</p>
                        <p>As a side note, keys can be also be called fields or properties</p>
				        <img src="https://mightybuddy.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/hash1.png?w=500">
				        <pre><code>//Create a new object with object literal
var newObj = {};

//Add a property called "five"
newObj.five = 5;
	
//Take value of "five" and add it
//to new property called "six"
newObj.six = newObj.five + 1;

//Another way to create this object
var newObj2 = {
    five: 5
};

//You can also use brackets instead of a "."
newObj["six"];  //returns 6</code></pre>
                        <h5>Try it!</h5>
                        <p>Here are some exercises you can try to get familiar with Javascript objects:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Add a field called <code>innerObj</code> to newObj</li>
                            <li>Set this field equal to a new object with a number field and a string field</li>
                            <li>Access these fields with both the bracket syntax and the dot syntax</li>
                        </ul>

	                <section id="windowAndDocument">
		                <h2>Special Objects</h2>
		                <p>We've actually been using the <code>window</code> object the whole time! All variables declared with <code>var</code> live there, and any code not assigned to an object automatically gets assigned to it. Let's take a look:</p>
		                <pre><code>var variableNamesAreHard = 1024;
window.variableNamesAreHard++; // increment the variable to 1025

//Returns 1025
window["variableNamesAreHard"];</code></pre>
		                <p>The window object is just like that new object we made earlier, except this one has a lot of stuff predefined for you.</p>

                        <h5>Try it!</h5>
                        <p>Add a property to the window object and try accessing it as a local variable.</p>

		                <p>Another object of significance that's defined for you is <code>document</code>. This one contains all of the HTML code of the page. We can get HTML objects in our code by using a function in the object: <code>document.getElementById</code>. We can then access and modify the text inside using the <code>innerText</code> property.</p>

		                <p>Let's try it out! The next section has a lot of common HTML tags defined with <code>id</code>s. Pick one and try to change its contents.</p>
		                <p>For example, since Web is the most important thing that MAD does, let's move it to the top of the list that's below, in the Testing Ground section.</p>
		                <pre><code>var topOfList=document.getElementById("firstli");
var third=document.getElementById("thirdli");
var lessImportant=topOfList.innerText;
topOfList.innerText=third.innerText;
third.innerText=lessImportant;</code></pre>

                        <h2>The Document Object Model</h2>
                        <p>The document object that you can access through the console is actually part of a larger design paradigm known as the document object model or "DOM". Initially, JavaScript and the DOM were very closely related, but both have evolved into separate entities.</p>
                        <p tag="advanced">The DOM is structured with a single <strong>document</strong> object and many HTML <strong>element</strong> objects. Each element also extends a more general interface known as a <strong>node</strong>. For more information, check out the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction#What_is_the_DOM">MDN docs</a>.</p>

                        <p>We learned how to manipulate an HTML page from JavaScript code. To do that, we also learned a bit about HTML tags.</p>
