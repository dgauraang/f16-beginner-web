  		<h1>Basic Object Oriented Programming</h1>
		<p>JavaScript objects are quite different from the objects of other languages, so let's get familiar with them. Then we can start using them to actually manipulate HTML on the page.</p>
		<p>They're a bit like HashMaps, which is to say that we don't need to list variables beforehand. We just create new ones whenever we want inside of out objects but putting a . after the object name.</p>

		<pre>
			<code>//Create a new object with object literal
var newObj={};

//Create a new variable
//called five inside newObj
newObj.five=5;
	
//Gets five out (which is 5),
//adds 1, and puts it in newObj.six
newObj.six=newObj.five+1;

//Using brackets is just as good
newObj["six"];  //returns 6</code>

		<h2>Special Objects</h2>
		<p>We've actually  been using the <code>window</code> object the whole time! All variables declared with var live there, and any code not assigned to an object automatically gets assigned to it. Let's take a look:</p>
		<pre>
<code>var variableNamesAreHard=1024;
window.variableNamesAreHard++;

//Returns 1025
window["variableNamesAreHard"];</code>
		</pre>
		<p>Just like that new object we made earlier, except this one has a lot of stuff predefined for you.</p>

		<p>Another object of significance that's defined for you is <code>document</code>. This one contains all of the HTML code of the page. We can get HTML objects in our code by using a function in the object: <code>document.getElementById</code>. We can then access and modify the text inside using the <code>innerText</code> property.</p>

		<p>Let's try it out! The next section has a lot of common HTML tags defined with <code>id</code>s. Pick one and try to change its contents.</p>
		<p>For example, since Web is the most important thing that MAD does, let's move it to the top of the list that's below, in the Testing Ground section.</p>
		<pre>
<code>var topOfList=document.getElementById("firstli");
var third=document.getElementById("thirdli");
var lessImportant=topOfList.innerText;
topOfList.innerText=third.innerText;
third.innerText=lessImportant;</code>
		</pre>

		<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
		<p>We learned how to manipulate an HTML page from JavaScript code. To do that, we also learned a bit about HTML tags.</p>
