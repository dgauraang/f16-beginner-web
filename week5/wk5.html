  				<h1>Front End: Positioning and Layout</h1>
  				<p>This week, the goal is to learn some techniques to make our pages better and more powerful.</p>
  				<p>So far, all we've done is layout the basic HTML structure and add colors and effects to the existing elements. However, it's possible to do so much more with HTML and CSS. Real webpages bend HTML elements to their will by using techniques to not only modify how HTML elements look, but also how they interact with each other.</p>

  			<h2>Box Model</h2>
  			<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Boxmodell-detail.png">
  			<p>When the browser creates a given HTML page, it represents all the elements as boxes on the screen. Each box has four parts: <strong>content</strong>, <strong>padding</strong>, <strong>border</strong>, and <strong>margin</strong>.</p>
  			<p><strong>Content area</strong>: space allocated for "real" content, such as text or images<br>
  			<strong>Padding area</strong>: space between borders and content, used for aesthetic purposes<br>
  			<strong>Border area</strong>: box including the border, which could be a physical line or invisible<br>
  			<strong>Margin area</strong>: space used to separate an element and its neighbors, used for aesthetic purposes and layout</p>
  			<p>Each of the styles that change how the box looks-padding, border, and margin-can be set in CSS.</p>
  			<pre><code>p {
    padding: 10px 5px;
    margin: 0px 10px 30px 6px;
    border: 1px solid black;
}</code></pre>
			<p>If four values are listed, the order is top, right, bottom, left.</p>
			<p>If two values are listed, the first is the top and bottom and the second is left and right.</p>
			<p>If one value is listed, they're all the same.</p>

			<h2>Display and Positioning</h2>
			<p>All HTML elements have a "display" characteristic that describes how the browser chooses to position it on the page. There are two main types of displays: <strong>block-level</strong>, <strong>inline-level</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Block</strong> elements take the whole width available and <strong>Inline</strong> elements act as plain text or take up at most the size of the content. You can also use the <strong>none</strong> property to hide an HTML element entirely.</p>
			<h3>Positioning</h3>
			<p><strong>Float</strong> is a way to shift an element left or right relative to the current line. Because HTML positions elements vertically, you need to use tools to handle horizontal positioning.</p>
			<pre><code>img {
	float: right;
	margin: 10px;
}</code></pre>
			<p><strong>Clear</strong> is float's complement and is used to place elements around a group of floated elements. To clear a floated group, you would clear the direction that the elements above are floated and then the element would placed as if it were in the normal HTML layout flow.</p>
			<pre><code>img2 {
	clear: right;
	margin: 10px;
}</code></pre>

			<h2>Flexbox</h2>
			<p>Another common styling tool is called Flexbox. It make general page layout much easier by creating a system of rows and columns for your elements to go in.</p>
			<img src="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flexbox-justify.png">
			<p>By default, HTML arranges items top to bottom. Flexbox allows items to be arranged horizontally very easily, and even allows items to wrap to the next line.</p>

	  		<h2>CSS Frameworks</h2>
	  		<p>CSS frameworks do a lot of the work for you, and we recommend them over any of the other positioning techniques that we've talked about.</p>
	  		<p>Two really good frameworks we recommend learning are <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
	  		<p>We'll demonstrate how to use Skeleton with an example from the starter code.</p>
