	  				<h1> Positioning and Layout</h1>
	  				<p>This week, the goal is to learn some techniques to make our pages better and more powerful.</p>
	  				<p>So far, all we've done is lay out the basic HTML structure and add colors and effects to the existing elements. However, it's possible to do so much more with HTML and CSS. Real webpages bend HTML elements to their will by using techniques to not only modify how HTML elements look, but also how they interact with each other.</p>

		  			<h2>Box Model</h2>

		  			<p>When the browser renders a page, it represents all of the HTML elements as boxes on the screen. Each box has four parts: <strong>content</strong>, <strong>padding</strong>, <strong>border</strong>, and <strong>margin</strong>.</p>
		  			<p><strong>Content area</strong>: space allocated for "real" content, such as text or images<br>
		  			<strong>Padding area</strong>: space between borders and content, used for aesthetic purposes<br>
		  			<strong>Border area</strong>: box including the border, which could be a physical line or invisible<br>
		  			<strong>Margin area</strong>: space used to separate an element and its neighbors, used for aesthetic purposes and layout</p>
		  			<p>Each of the styles that change how the box looks – padding, border, and margin – can be set in CSS.</p>
		  			<pre><code>p {
	padding: 10px 5px;
	margin: 0px 10px 30px 6px;
	border: 1px solid black;
}</code></pre>
					<p>If four values are listed, the order is top, right, bottom, left. If two values are listed, the first is the top and bottom and the second is left and right. If one value is listed, they're all the same.</p>

                <section id="display">
                    <h2>Display and Positioning</h2>
                    <p>All HTML elements have a "display" property that describes how the browser chooses to position it on the page. There are two main types of displays: <strong>block-level</strong> and <strong>inline-level</strong>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Block</strong> elements take the whole width available and <strong title="an inline element">inline</strong> elements take up at most the size of the content. You can also use the <strong>none</strong> property to hide an HTML element entirely.</p>
                    <h3>Positioning</h3>
                    <p><strong>Float</strong> is a way to shift an element left or right relative to the current line. Because HTML positions elements vertically, you need to use tools to handle horizontal positioning.</p>
                    <pre><code>img {
    float: right;
    margin: 10px;
}</code></pre>
                    <p><strong>Clear</strong> is float's complement and is used to place elements around a group of floated elements. To clear a floated group, you would clear the direction that the elements above are floated and then the element would placed as if it were in the normal HTML layout flow.</p>
                    <pre><code>img2 {
    clear: right;
    margin: 10px;
}</code></pre>

                    <h3>Element Position</h3>
                    <p>The <code>position</code> property is usually used to position an element outside of the flow of the page. Based on its value, the properties <strong>top</strong>, <strong>bottom</strong>, <strong>right</strong>, <strong>left</strong> change the position of the element. Its values can be:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>relative:</strong> the position properties will offset element from where it normally lies on the page</li>
                      <li><strong>absolute:</strong> the position properties specify offset from the edges of the containing block.</li>
                      <li><strong>sticky:</strong> the position is relative until some special conditions are satisfied.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Check <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position">the MDN documentation</a> for more information.</p>

                    <h3>Box Sizing</h3>
                    <p>The <code>box-sizing</code> property defines how the width and height of an HTML element are calculated.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>content-box:</strong> width and height refer to the content box</li>
                      <li><strong>border-box:</strong> width and height apply to the border box, makes it easier to size elements</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Flexbox</h2>
                    <p>Another common styling tool is called Flexbox. It make general page layout much easier by creating a system of rows and columns for your elements to go in.</p>
                    <img width="100%" src="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/flexbox-justify.png">
                    <p>By default, HTML arranges items top to bottom. Flexbox allows items to be arranged horizontally very easily, and even allows items to wrap to the next line.</p>

                    <h2>CSS Frameworks</h2>
                    <p>CSS frameworks do a lot of the work for you, and we recommend them over any of the other positioning techniques that we've talked about.</p>
                    <p>Two really good frameworks we recommend learning are <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. We'll demonstrate how to use Skeleton with an example from the starter code.</p>
