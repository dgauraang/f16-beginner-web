                    <h1>HTTP and the Internet</h1>
                    <p>Most of the internet uses a protocol called HTTP. This stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol, which means it transfer "HyperText" between computers on an interconnected network.</p>
                    <p>HTML or HyperText Markup Language is the main type of "HyperText" being transferred with this protocol. However, the principles of the protocol are so general that any data can be transferred with it, like files or JSON.</p>

                    <h2>Client-Server Architecture</h2>
                    <img width=100% src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Client-server-model.svg/500px-Client-server-model.svg.png">
                    <p>The Internet works on a <i>client server model</i>, where anyone who tries to access a webpage makes an <i>HTTP request</i> to a computer across the Internet. That computer is called a server and provides a <i>response</i> in the form of some data. This data is often an HTML page.</p>
                    <p>In general, an HTTP request can ask for anything and provide any information as long as it is formatted according to protocol specifications. However, the most common request is a webpage "GET" request, which your browser sends every time you load a new webpage.</p>
                    <h2>OSI Model</h2>
                    <p>This is a more detailed description of the different roles hardware and software play in the internet.</p>

                    <h2>REST vs HTTP</h2>
                    <p>REST or "representational state transfer" refers to some design constraints that are used to create web services. These constraints include using a stateless protocol and a client-server architecture. Services using the HTTP protocol generally satisfy REST constraints.</p>

                    <h2>HTTP Requests</h2>
                    <img src="https://ubidots.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/HTTP.png">
                    <h3>The Request</h3>
                    <pre><code>GET /website.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.domain.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
Accept: text/xml,text/html,text/plain
Accept-Language: en-us,en

param=value&amp;param2=val2</code></pre>
                    <p>Above is an example of what a GET request looks like. All HTTP requests have a "verb" like GET or POST. This verb is a convention that specifies the type of operation.</p>
                    <p>Some common verbs: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>GET</strong>: Retrieving data from the server</li>
                        <li><strong>POST</strong>: Sending data to create an object on the server</li>
                        <li><strong>PUT</strong>: Sending data to update an object on the server</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The other lines below the verb are <em>headers</em>, which specify metadata about the request that the server might find useful. The bottom line is the body. For a GET request, you can only send "query parameters", which are keys and values. For a POST request, you can send more complicated data, such as JSON or XML.</p>
                    <h3>The Response</h3>
                    <pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Tue, 09 Oct 2018 01:11:12 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.12 (Win32)
Last-Modified: Tue, 09 Oct 2018 01:11:12 GMT
Accept-Ranges: "bytes"
Content-Length: 1000
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;html&gt;some text ...&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>Above is an example of an HTTP Response. The first line specifies the protocol and the <strong>HTTP status code</strong>. This code represents how the request went, and these codes are important to know.</p>
                    <p>Types of status codes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>2XX</strong>: Everything went OK</li>
                        <li><strong>3XX</strong>: Redirect error code</li>
                        <li><strong>4XX</strong>: User error. 404 is page not found, for example.</li>
                        <li><strong>5XX</strong>: Server error. 500 is the general code for some internal server error.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The rest of the information are headers the server provides and then the body of the response, which is hopefully what you requested.</p>

                <section id="ajax">
                    <h2>AJAX</h2>
                    <p>Generally, when you go to a website, your browser requests an HTML page for you. That's because HTML will show up on your browser as a nice pretty website.</p>
                    <p>Your computer, though, doesn't care about how the page looks. The computer just needs the data. To accommodate this need, many sites also send their data in <i>JSON</i> format.</p>
                    <img width=100% src="https://dzone.com/storage/temp/4984978-screen-shot-2017-04-17-at-114949-am.png">
                    <p>This format is standardized, so someone already wrote something to convert to and from this format. It is a default function written in the webpage.</p>
                    <p>We're gonna use our knowledge of HTTP requests to ask for some JSON and manipulate it. The way we do this is through an XMLHttpRequest object:</p>
                    <pre><code>var gotData = function(){
    if(this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200){
        window.data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
    } 
}
  
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.open("GET", "example.json");
req.overrideMimeType("application/json");
  
req.onreadystatechange = gotData;
req.send();</code></pre>
                    <p>This is usually used to communicate with the computer that your HTML files are on. While these requests can technically be made to any computer connected to the Internet, doing so from inside your browser is a security risk, so most browsers and sites prevent it from happening.<p>
                    <p>Instead, many sites have APIs you can use, and most of them make it free for the first few thousand requests per day. After that, you're probably running a successful website and the company running the service charges based on the number of requests. Some of these also prevent you from making requests from in the browser, </p>
                    <p>A good example of what is available is the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps API</a>.</p>

                <section id="preservingState">
                    <h2>Preserving State</h2>
                    <p>HTTP is called a <i>stateless protocol</i> because it can't remember what has already happened. It gets all the information it needs from the request. Once you get a given webpage, the server forgets who you are.</p>
                    <p>Then how can we preserve data like login information in between webpage requests?</p>
                    <img src="http://josh.webanalyticsdemystified.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/cookies.png">
                    <p>The most common way is to use <i>cookies</i>, small pieces of data that get sent to the server every time a request is made to it. This allows the server to keep a list of people it is currently in contact with.</p>
                    <pre><code>document.cookie = "test=5"
document.cookie = "test2=hello"</code></pre>
                    <p>While assigning cookies is that simple (if you want to use all the default settings), retrieving them <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-deal-with-cookies-in-javascript/">can be a pain</a>.</p>
                    <pre><code>function getCookie(name) {
    // This is just magic, really
    var regexp = new RegExp("(?:^" + name + "|;\s*"
                                + name + ")=(.*?)(?:;|$)", "g");
    var result = regexp.exec(document.cookie);
    return (result === null) ? null : result[1];
}</code></pre>
                    <p>As a result, cookies are usually handled server-side, where they are much easier to work with. If you need to work with them in the browser, it is probably best to Google how to access them.</p>
                    <p>Cookies aren't the only way to keep information between sessions, though. Cookies are always sent to the server so that the server can see who they are talking to, but if the information only needs to be kept locally, there are alternatives. Both localStorage and sessionStorage are kept in browser and provide a form of memory for the browser.</p>
                    <pre><code>sessionStorage.setItem("test", 5);
localStorage.setItem("test2", "hello");

// returns "5"
sessionStorage.getItem("test");</code></pre>
                    <img src="http://5823-presscdn-0-11.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/localstorage.jpg">
                    <p>It is important to note that localStorage remains until the clear() function is called with it (or the user clears the data in their browser), while sessionStorage only remains until the browser is closed and reopened. Both can only store strings, so any other kind of data will be converted to a string when put into storage.</p>

                    <h2>Try It Out</h2>
                    <p>The <a href="https://github.com/txcsmad/f16-beginner-web">starter code today</a> is the same as last time, but with localStorage, we can now keep the data recieved for future reference. Try modifying the code to keep important data you get from the server.</p>
                    <p>There is a demo page for the CSS and AJAX on <a href="https://github.com/txcsmad/f16-beginner-web">GitHub</a>.</p>
